- A non-binary Gen-Z skateboarder with a half-shaved lavender head and a vintage Hermès scarf

▶ LINE 4 — ASIDE: Blogger's sassy camera comment on stranger's reaction. 10-15 words. (Smirky, slightly savage)

▶ LINES 5-7 — Alternating BLOGGER follow-up questions and STRANGER answers. Build the reaction. 10-18 words each.

- HARD LIMIT: 20 words per line
- NO stage directions, NO asterisks, NO parentheses
- The ASIDE lines are the blogger talking to the camera, not to the stranger — cheeky, slightly mean, very funny
- Blogger's language style: Use modern youth slang, popular TikTok expressions, and vibrant internet language (e.g., "vibes", "literally", "no cap", "serving", "slay", or their French/Russian equivalents depending on the language).
- Blogger's body language in text: Reflect a highly energetic personality with lively gestures and expressive body language implicitly through the phrasing.
- Use punctuation "!", "?", "?!", "..." for expressiveness
- The stranger should sound authentic and slightly awkward/funny

Create a new FrenchTalk street encounter script in ${language} inspired by this content.
Blogger: ${bloggerName} (young, cheeky, beautiful French woman)
Stranger type: ${strangerType || 'a random person on the street'}

Format:
- "${bloggerName}: [text]" — blogger questions
- "Stranger: [text]" — stranger responses
- "Aside: [text]" — blogger's sassy aside to camera
- "Outro: [text]" — blogger's cheeky call-to-action to viewers (like/subscribe).

THE LAST LINE MUST ALWAYS BE "Outro:" — TWO parts in one line (MAX 22-24 words total):
   PART 1: Ask viewers how THEY would answer the question (e.g. "А ты бы что ответил? Пиши в комментариях!" or "And you? What would YOU say? Tell me in the comments!"). 8-12 words.
   PART 2: Cheeky CTA for like/subscribe.
🎭 THIS TIME the CTA mood is: "${ctaStyleVA.mood.toUpperCase()}" — ${ctaStyleVA.direction}
Invent a UNIQUE CTA phrase that matches this energy. Inspired by (but NEVER copying) these examples:
${ctaSamplesVA}
Must be original, match the ${ctaStyleVA.mood} mood, 8-12 words.
TOTAL OUTRO LINE: 18-24 words. Do NOT exceed 24 words.

Exactly ${lineCount.split('-')[1]} lines, MAX 20 words per line.

Output ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "topic": "Topic in ${language}",
  "topicEn": "Topic in English",
  "topicRu": "Topic in Russian",
  "hook": "Viral hook in ${language} (MAX 8 words)",
  "hookRu": "Hook in Russian",

══════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ CRITICAL SPEECH AND ROLE RULES:
1. THIS IS A SPOKEN VLOG SCRIPT. EVERY SINGLE LINE (both Vlog Action and Blogger Comment) IS REAL SPOKEN DIALOGUE / VOICE-OVER BY ${bloggerName}.
2. DO NOT write 3rd-person descriptions like "Camille en pyjama masse son visage". Write FIRST-PERSON spoken lines!
3. PROVIDE REAL, VALUABLE CONTENT: Do NOT generate empty aesthetic fluff. If the topic is cooking, you MUST provide a real recipe with actual ingredients and steps (e.g. "First, I fry 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil", "Add 100g of fresh basil"). If the topic is lifestyle or fashion, provide a practical, concrete tip the viewer can actually use.
4. GENERATE EXACTLY 7 TO 9 LINES TOTAL (MINIMUM 7 CLIPS).
5. HARD WORD COUNT LIMIT: EVERY LINE MUST CONTAIN 12 TO 22 WORDS (Optimized for an 8-second video clip). Count your words carefully for each line!
══════════════════════════════════════

STRUCTURE (7-9 spoken lines):
▶ LINE 1 — Vlog Action: ${bloggerName} introduces the specific task/recipe/topic she is doing in ${location}. 12-20 words.
▶ LINE 2 — Blogger Comment: First concrete, actionable tip or specific ingredient/step directly to camera. 12-22 words.
▶ LINE 3 — Vlog Action: ${bloggerName} speaks while performing the next specific step (with real details) in ${location}. 12-20 words.
▶ LINE 4 — Blogger Comment: Second valuable advice, secret, or specific instruction to camera. 12-22 words.
▶ LINE 5 — Vlog Action: ${bloggerName} speaks while showing the final result or final step in ${location}. 12-20 words.
▶ LINE 6 — Blogger Comment: Final cheeky advice / vlog commentary summarizing the value provided. 12-22 words.
▶ LINE 7+ — Outro: Flirty, witty call-to-action asking for likes, comments & subscribe. 10-18 words.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR CREATIVE VARIETY:
Do NOT repeat phrases, structure, or topics! Every single reply must cover a completely DIFFERENT topic, emotion, and conversational situation. Avoid boring generic thank-yous. Make them rich, lively, intimate, funny, sassy, and genuinely engaging!

Generate exactly:
1. "talking_replies": 15 short French spoken replies to imaginary chat viewers (10 to 18 words each). Each must follow a distinct theme:
   - Reply 1: Commenting on her outfit or style of the day.
   - Reply 2: A playful reaction to a flirtatious or humorous chat comment.
   - Reply 3: Sharing a Parisian daily life observation or cafe adventure.
   - Reply 4: Asking viewers about their favorite hobby or mood today.
   - Reply 5: A witty piece of girl advice or lifestyle philosophy.
   - Reply 6: Talking about French food, wine, coffee, or pastries.
   - Reply 7: Teasing an upcoming mystery project or travel plan.
   - Reply 8: Reacting to the relaxing vibe of her room/setting right now.
   - Reply 9: Sassy commentary on modern relationships or dating in Paris.
   - Reply 10: Sending warmth and encouragement to someone feeling down.
   - Reply 11: A cute joke or playful confession about her weekend habits.
   - Reply 12: Responding to a question about French culture or romance.
   - Reply 13: Asking fans to guess her secret talent or dream destination.
   - Reply 14: Commenting on music, books, or a movie she loves.
   - Reply 15: Sending a cozy evening or morning blessing to all viewers.

2. "gift_reactions": 3 excited French gift/donation thank-you expressions (10 to 16 words each). Each must have a different energetic tone:
   - Reaction 1: Romantic & flirtatious (air kisses, sweet adoration).
   - Reaction 2: Explosive joy & shock (overwhelmed gratitude, laughing).
   - Reaction 3: Playful VIP honor (proclaiming the donor a superstar or champion of the chat).

SUBJECT & FRAMING: A hyperrealistic vertical 9:16 influencer livestream portrait of the exact same young beautiful French woman from the first reference image. Prominent close-to-medium conversational portrait framing, filling the foreground of the shot as she sits comfortably on her couch in her Parisian home (${dayInfo.location}). She is looking straight into the camera lens with a warm, cheerful, inviting smile.
OUTFIT: She is wearing exactly: ${dayInfo.outfit}.
REALISM & DETAILS: Skin with visible micro-texture, natural pores, subtle sebaceous shine, soft subsurface scattering (SSS), natural lip texture with vertical striations, moist corneas. Hyperrealistic eyes: depth and wetness of iris, micro-reflections in cornea, natural eyelid crease, individual eyelashes with natural variation.
CAMERA & LENS: Shot on Hasselblad X2D with 80mm f/1.4 portrait lens (wide-open f/1.4 aperture for ultra shallow depth of field), medium format rendering, film-like micro-contrast, prominent 3D subject pop with clean separation from the background.
LIGHTING & DEPTH OF FIELD: Lit by soft window light and warm ambient room lamps, wraparound fill light, natural skin gradients without harsh specular highlights, catchlight in eyes from indoor window reflection. Cinematic shallow depth of field with realistic optical background blur: while the woman in the foreground is razor-sharp down to every micro-detail of her eyelashes and skin, the entire interior living room behind her (walls, paintings, plants, lamp, curtain, window from the second reference image) is gently and beautifully out of focus (softened with creamy optical background blur at f/1.4 and warm practical light bokeh balls). Professional award-winning photography quality, artistic optical separation between sharp foreground subject and soft blurred ambient background. ${CINEMATIC_MODIFIERS}`;
