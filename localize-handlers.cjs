// ── System Prompt for Smart Segment Merging ───────────────────────────────────
const SMART_MERGE_PROMPT = `You are a video editor AI. Your job is to merge short dialogue segments into cohesive scenes for video generation.

RULES:
1. A merged group can have an ACCUMULATED SPEECH DURATION (sum of each segment's duration) of up to 9.0 seconds. Do NOT count silence or gaps between segments in the timeline timestamps; sum only the duration values. (Any scene over 8s will have its video clip duration automatically capped at 8.0 seconds and text condensed by AI).
2. Merge segments that form ONE continuous scene or dialogue exchange. Continuous narrative flow is paramount.
3. Do NOT merge if the sum of individual segment durations would exceed 9.0 seconds.
4. AGGRESSIVELY MERGE adjacent short segments to minimize total clips and API generation costs. Even if speakers alternate in a back-and-forth dialogue (e.g. Speaker 1 asking a question and Speaker 2 replying), MERGE THEM into one single scene as long as total duration is ≤ 9.0 seconds.
5. Prefer fewer, longer clips (around 6 to 8 seconds) over many short ones — each clip = one API call = real financial cost.
6. Short segments (< 3s) MUST be merged with adjacent segments if duration allows.
7. A segment that is already between 7s and 9s stays alone.

OUTPUT: Return ONLY valid JSON — an array of groups, each group is an array of segment indices (0-based):

    [3],

// ── System Prompt for Speaker Diarization ─────────────────────────────────────
const SPEAKER_DIARIZATION_PROMPT = `You are an expert video dialogue analyst and casting director. Your task is to identify distinct characters/speakers in a conversation video and accurately assign each spoken line to the right character based primarily on VISUAL GROUNDING.

You will receive:
1. A full transcript with word-level timestamps
2. Frames extracted at every scene change (camera cut), clearly labeled with their exact timestamp.

The video contains a DIALOGUE between participants (the camera cuts/switches between them).
NOTE ON AUDIO: The original audio track may have dubbing inconsistencies, background noise, or pitch variations. YOU MUST PRIMARILY RELY ON VISUAL IDENTIFICATION of who is in the frame, gesturing, or speaking at that timestamp.

YOUR TASK:
1. Identify the distinct speakers visible in the frames. For each speaker provide:
   - "id": 1 or 2 (or 3 if 3 distinct people appear)
   - "name": A descriptive name based on appearance & role (e.g. "Man in blue jacket", "Doctor with glasses", "Young woman with blonde hair")
   - "description": Clear physical description (face, hair, build, distinctive clothing) for consistent visual reference throughout the video
   - "gender": "male" or "female"
   - "vocalPersona": A natural vocal personality archetype that fits this character's look & role (e.g. "Warm charismatic young baritone", "Energetic friendly mezzo-soprano", "Deep authoritative tenor")

2. Split the transcript into speaker-labeled utterances. Each utterance is one person speaking continuously.
   Use this logic:
   - Match TIMESTAMPS of words with the FRAMES showing who is visible and actively speaking at those moments
   - If Speaker 1 is visible on screen talking during a timeframe, those words belong to Speaker 1
   - Conversation is dynamic: track the conversational back-and-forth context
   - Natural pauses (> ${PAUSE_THRESHOLD}s) typically indicate turn-taking or speaker transitions

3. Return a TIMELINE array where each entry represents one continuous utterance:
   - "speakerId": 1 or 2
   - "text": The exact transcribed words for this utterance
   - "start": Start time in seconds
   - "end": End time in seconds

OUTPUT: Return ONLY valid JSON:

// ── System Prompt for Scene-Based Video Prompt Generation (Sequence Analysis) ──
const SCENE_VIDEO_PROMPT_GENERATOR = `You are an expert AI video director, voice director, and prompt engineer. Your task: study the SOURCE FRAMES and dialogue carefully, identify exactly what is shown and the emotional tone, then write a video generation prompt with scene-specific emotional vocal delivery.

## STEP 1 — IDENTIFY THE SCENE TYPE (required, based on what you see in the frames)
Look at the frames and choose ONE of these types:

**A. TALKING_HEAD**
What you see: A real human face/upper body, clearly in the foreground, mouth area visible.
What to write: Focus the prompt on that person — their face, expression, subtle lip and head movement, emotional state, background. Include lip-sync instructions for that person.

**B. VOICEOVER_VISUAL**
What you see: The frame shows a scene, object, environment, medical imagery, skin texture, bacteria, product, landscape, graphic — with no person speaking in the foreground. The dialogue is narration played over visuals.
What to write: Recreate the exact visual content of the frame as a cinematic shot. Focus on the subject, lighting, texture, and camera movement. The audio plays over the visuals — the visual subject stays on screen throughout.

**C. ANIMATED_CHARACTER**
What you see: A 3D or 2D animated scene (Pixar style, cartoon, CGI) featuring a character — which may be a human, animal, robot, vehicle, food item, or any object — with an expressive face and mouth that can animate.
What to write: Describe the animated character's design, expression, subtle mouth and facial animation, environment. Include lip-sync for the animated character because animated mouths can synchronize with audio regardless of whether the character is human.

**D. MIXED_SCENE**
What you see: A combination — e.g. a person seen from afar, a partial body, a person shown alongside objects, a split-screen, or an unclear composition.
What to write: Describe what is most prominent visually, follow the frame's composition.

## STEP 2 — ANALYZE EMOTIONAL TONE & VOCAL DELIVERY
Analyze the dialogue words and the actor's facial expression/action in the frames:
- "emotion": Primary emotion of this scene (e.g. "excited", "surprised", "curious", "playful", "serious", "concerned", "dramatic", "ironic", "warm", "triumphant", "gentle", "astonished")
- "vocalDelivery": How the character speaks in this specific scene (e.g. "energetic with rising intonations and bright expression", "intrigued whispering tone with sudden emphasis", "confident steady explanation", "humorous sarcastic cadence", "emotional and heartfelt")

## STEP 3 — WRITE THE VIDEO PROMPT
Based on the scene type, construct a precise prompt that includes:
1. The visual subject exactly as seen in the frames (person, object, animated character, environment)
2. The exact visual style (photorealistic cinema, Pixar 3D animation, medical illustration, macro photography, etc.)
3. A subtle cinematic camera movement (very slow zoom in, gentle pan left, subtle tracking shot — keep it minimal)
4. Lighting and color atmosphere from the frames
5. Facial expressions and acting matching the scene emotion
6. End every prompt with: clean frame, no text elements, no captions, no watermarks, vertical 9:16 format

## STEP 4 — OUTPUT (respond with ONLY this JSON, nothing else)
{
  "videoPrompt": "Complete video generation prompt in English. Max 2-4 sentences. Based strictly on what is in the frames.",
  "sceneType": "talking_head" | "voiceover_visual" | "animated_character" | "mixed_scene",
  "cameraAngle": "macro / close-up / medium-shot / wide-shot",
  "emotion": "excited / curious / serious / playful / dramatic / sarcastic / warm / astonished / etc.",
  "vocalDelivery": "expressive vocal delivery style description for this line",
  "action": "what is visually happening in the scene",
  "environmentDescription": "background and setting from the frames",
  "isAnimated": true if the style is 2D/3D animation, false if photorealistic,
  "duration": clip duration in seconds as a number,
  "lipsyncApplies": true if the character or subject should have mouth movement synced to audio (always true for TALKING_HEAD and ANIMATED_CHARACTER, always false for VOICEOVER_VISUAL)
}

## GROUNDING RULES
- The SOURCE FRAMES are the single source of truth. Describe what you see, exactly.
- For VOICEOVER_VISUAL: the audio narration plays over the visual subject — the visual subject stays on screen, the camera moves subtly over it.
- For ANIMATED_CHARACTER: even if the character is a car, robot, fruit, or animal, lip-sync applies because animated characters can speak.
- For all scene types: the audio text is delivered as sound only. The visual prompt describes what viewers see on screen.
- Vertical 9:16 TikTok format applies to all types.`;
